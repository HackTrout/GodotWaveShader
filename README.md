# GodotWaveShader
A shader for creating top down waves in Godot

Some things to note when using this shader:
- Sprites should have some transparent space above and below the main sprite, 
this ensures the sprite doesn't wrap around the other side of the sprite when the shader is active.

I made this shader for my game Crossfire so I'd be grateful if you could try it out when I release it on https://hacktrout.itch.io/.
